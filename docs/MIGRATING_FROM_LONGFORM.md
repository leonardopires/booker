# Migrating from Longform

## Why someone might migrate

If you enjoy writing long documents in Obsidian and want a simple, focused way to assemble notes into a final output, Booker can feel familiar while giving you a clear path from notes to a finished document.

## Concept mapping

| Longform concept | Booker concept |
| --- | --- |
| Longform project | bundle |
| Longform compile | generate |
| Longform scenes | source notes |

## What Booker does differently (and why)

Booker centers your work on recipes and bundles, which keeps structure visible even as your draft evolves. This encourages a steady, intentional build from small notes to large documents, with a consistent output format you can generate whenever you need.

## What Booker does NOT do

- It does not change how you write your notes.
- It does not force a specific writing order.
- It does not replace your creative process.

## How Table of Contents generation replaces Longform’s structure view

When you generate output, Booker can add a Table of Contents. This becomes a navigational map inside the output itself, so you can review structure as you read, rather than switching to a separate view.

## Step-by-step conceptual migration guide

1. Identify one Longform project you want to try in Booker.
2. Treat each existing scene as a separate source note.
3. Create a recipe that lists those notes in the order you want.
4. Generate the recipe output to confirm the chapter flow.
5. If you have multiple chapters, create a bundle that lists your recipes.
6. Generate the bundle output to see the full document.

## You don’t have to change how you write

Booker is designed to support your current habits. You can keep drafting in the way that works for you and simply use recipes and bundles to shape the final output.
