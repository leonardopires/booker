# Writing Guide: Longform Work with Booker

## What problem Booker solves for writers

Writing a long document in Obsidian often means juggling dozens of notes, losing track of order, and reworking structure late in the process. Booker helps you turn scattered notes into a single, readable output while keeping your working notes flexible and easy to move around. It keeps your drafting space clean and your final document consistent.

## Mental model

Think of Booker as a simple ladder of scale:

- Notes as building blocks: each scene, idea, or reference lives in its own note.
- Recipes as chapters: a recipe collects the notes you want in a specific order.
- Bundles as books: a bundle collects multiple recipes into one long output.

## A recommended writing workflow

### Writing scenes

Write each scene or section in its own note. This keeps your focus narrow and makes it easy to move or revise one piece at a time. If you work in acts or parts, treat those as groups of scenes rather than single notes.

### Grouping scenes into recipes

When a set of scenes belongs together, add them to a recipe in the order you want readers to experience. Think of each recipe as a chapter or a major section.

### Grouping recipes into bundles

When multiple recipes belong in a single long document, collect them into a bundle. This becomes your full manuscript or report output.

## How Table of Contents helps navigation in long documents

Table of Contents generation gives you a clean map of your output. It helps you jump to chapters, sections, or major beats without hunting through a single long file. When you generate, your output includes a Table of Contents that reflects the structure you built with recipes and bundles.

## How notices help you understand what was generated

Notices tell you what Booker created and where it was saved. They help you confirm that the right target was generated and point you to any missing pieces, such as a note that did not resolve as expected. This keeps you confident that the output matches your intentions.

## Common mistakes writers make (and how Booker helps avoid them)

- Writing everything in one note: Booker keeps your work modular so revisions are easier.
- Losing order when rearranging: recipes preserve a clear sequence.
- Forgetting what is in the final document: the generated output is a single source of truth.
- Skipping navigation aids: Table of Contents generation keeps long documents easy to navigate.

## A short daily writing workflow example

1. Draft a new scene in its own note.
2. Add that note to the current recipe in the right spot.
3. Generate the recipe output to review the chapter.
4. Once a week, generate the bundle output to see the full manuscript shape.

This routine keeps you focused on today’s writing while still checking the big picture.
