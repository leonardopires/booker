# Simple Article Example

This is the smallest useful Booker setup: a handful of short notes compiled into one article.

## Files

- **Article Recipe.md** — the Booker recipe that merges the notes below into one output file.
- **Article Intro.md** — opening paragraph for the article.
- **Article Body.md** — the main idea and supporting details.
- **Article Closing.md** — a short wrap‑up.

## How to Run

1. Open **Article Recipe.md** in Obsidian.
2. Run **Booker: Generate current file**.

## Expected Output

Booker will create `./output/simple-article.md` with the three notes merged in the order listed.
