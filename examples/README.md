# Booker Examples

Welcome! These examples are small, real-world vaults you can copy into your own notes to see Booker in action.
Each folder is self-contained, so you can try one without setting up anything else.

## How to Use These Examples

1. Pick a folder below.
2. Copy the entire folder into your vault.
3. Open the recipe or bundle note in Obsidian.
4. Run **Booker: Generate current file**.

Booker will create the output file at the path listed in the note’s frontmatter.

## Suggested Order

1. **01-simple-article** — the smallest useful setup
2. **02-book-with-chapters** — a realistic non‑fiction book
3. **03-novel-acts-and-scenes** — fiction‑friendly structure

## Copying Into a Real Vault

To keep things tidy, drop an example folder into a dedicated area like `Booker Examples/`.
You can then rename files or move them into your project structure once you’re comfortable.

## Note for Longform Users

If you used Longform, start with example 03.
